# Picuno (PICO + UNO)
A repo of all files for the pic uno RP2040+Arduino UNO derivative by ESCcrasci and AtrivaTECH <br>
Associated article: https://esccrasci.in/picuno/ <br>
File Hierarchy will be updated periodically.<br>

GPIOs <s>will be</s> 5V tolerant (Select GPIOs) with level shifting. At the moment, 6 GPIOs will be level shifted to 5 volts unlike competitors. Also working on shifting all GPIOs to 5V for better compatibility. <br>
SparkFun QWIIC is also <s>going to be</s> implemented.  <br>

Note that all of the gerber files and kicad files present at root are of V1 and can be ignored. File hierarchy shall be updated below soon.
